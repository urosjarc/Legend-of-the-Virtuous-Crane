Yudhishthira you are the wisest man in the world! And the most righetoust one too!
I grant you a boon, ask me for the life of any one of your brothers.

Give me Nakula.

I'm surprised. I know Bhima is dearest to you amont all your brothers. You depend on Arjuna to win the war thats coming. Yeat you chose Nakulas life over others. Why?

Yaksha. I have two mothers. Kunti and Mathuri. I the son of Kunti am alive. Surely the son of Mathuri, should also live.

Ha ha ha ha ha, aaa, you are a great soul indeed Yudhishthira! I will never look apon another, like you in all time.
I grant you, not joust Nakula's life but, the life of all your brothers!
