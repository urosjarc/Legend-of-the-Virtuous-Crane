Stop!
Do not drink the watter, before answering my questions!

Who are you!?
Where are you!?
Show your self!!
Who are you!!
Are you Rudra!?
A marath!?
Or a vasu!?
You must be strong, to put this powerfull brothers of mine down!!
Your feat is remarkable.
Who are you!?

This pond belongs to me!
Your brothers died, because they drank from its waters, before answering my questions!
Do you wish to suffer the same faith?

I do not wish to take water that does not belong to me.
Ask me a questions, and I'll answer as best as I can.
